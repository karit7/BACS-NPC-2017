# BACS NPC 2017

This is an implementation of the Bangladesh Advanced Computing Society National Programming Camp(BACS NPC), 2017 training camp. For simplicity, while implementing, I have only focused the core lessions which showed in the sessions. For this, I have overlooked some small portion's optimizations in the code. My main motivation of this work is that someone who wants to get familiar with these problem solving topics.
I will keep updating this time to time.
